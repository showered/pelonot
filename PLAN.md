# Pelonot — Implementation Plan

> **Open-Source Peloton Client** — A subscription-free fitness app for jailbroken Peloton bikes (Gen 1/Gen 2).

---

## How to use this plan

1. **Each checkbox is one focused task** — small enough for a single session, large enough to matter.
2. **A box is only ticked when the behaviour has been observed working**, not when the code was written. Several items in this plan were previously ticked while the feature was non-functional (see *Corrections* below); that is the failure mode this rule exists to prevent.
3. **Work phases in order** where later ones build on earlier ones. Phase 11 is the current priority.
4. When switching models or sessions, paste the current plan state so the next session knows where to pick up.

## Corrections — items previously ticked that were not working

Recorded so the same mistakes are not repeated, and because several of these
were the *reason* a downstream feature looked broken.

| Item | Was ticked | Reality |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 1.11 Supabase repository | ✅ | Passed `Map<String, Any?>` to kotlinx.serialization, which has no serializer for `Any`. Every call threw and was swallowed by `runCatching`. |
| 2.3 BLE heart rate | ✅ | `connectGatt(null, …)`; CCCD descriptor never written, so the strap was never asked to notify. No reading could ever arrive. |
| 2.5 Metrics calculator | ✅ | Integrated power against sample *count*, not elapsed time — a 45-minute ride over-reported energy by ~1000×. |
| 3.4 Per-second metric recording | ✅ | `workout_metrics` has a foreign key onto `workouts`, but the workout row was only written at ride *end*. Every insert violated the constraint. No ride ever stored a time series. |
| 5.7 Power zone calculator | ✅ | Zone ranges left gaps (0.55–0.56 etc.); a lookup that matched nothing fell through to Z7, so an easy warmup was reported as Neuromuscular Power. |
| 6.6 Class detail screen | ✅ | Interval model used camelCase field names against snake_case assets. Every decode threw and was caught into `emptyList()`. No class ever displayed an interval. |
| 8.3 Crash recovery | ✅ | `getIncompleteWorkout()` returned the most recent workout with no completion filter, so the app offered to resume the ride you had just finished, on every launch. |
| 8.7 Unit tests | ✅ | `PostWorkoutAnalyzerTest.kt` was committed empty. |
| 8.8 Instrumented tests | ✅ | `WorkoutDaoTest` referenced `localUserId` / `classTemplateId`, fields that never existed on the entity. It had never compiled. |
| 8.11.17 Dashboard redesign | ✅ | Shipped with `"12.5"` and `"8.3"` kJ hardcoded, and a constant "FTP Stable" badge, shown as the rider's own statistics. |
| 8.5 Haptic feedback | ✅ | The app never declared `android.permission.VIBRATE`. Every call threw `SecurityException` into a `runCatching`, so the buzz simply never happened. Found by reading logcat during a real ride — it is invisible from the UI. |
| 8.8 Instrumented DAO tests | ✅ | Rewritten so they compiled, and ticked — but `@Before fun setup() = runBlocking { … }` infers its return type from the last expression, and `insertUser` returns a row id. JUnit rejects a `@Before` that is not void, so the class failed to initialise and **all ten tests silently never ran**. They pass now. |
| 8.3a Crash recovery prompt | (untickable) | The service exposed `recoverableWorkout`, but nothing binds to the service on a cold start — which is exactly the situation a crash leaves behind — so the prompt could never have appeared wherever it was rendered. |

All of the above are now fixed and covered by tests.

---

## Phase 0: Project Scaffolding & Build System ✅

- [x] **0.1** Android project structure
- [x] **0.2** `minSdk 24`, `targetSdk 34`, `compileSdk 34`
- [x] **0.3** Dependencies wired (Compose, Material3, Room + KSP, Coroutines, Supabase, WorkManager, Navigation, Lifecycle, DataStore)
- [x] **0.4** `AndroidManifest.xml` with permissions
- [x] **0.5** `PelonotApp` application class
- [x] **0.6** Builds and runs
- [x] **0.7** Dependencies centralised in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`
- [x] **0.8** Supabase credentials moved out of source into `local.properties` → `BuildConfig`
- [x] **0.9** R8 enabled for release with kotlinx-serialization / Ktor / Room keep rules

---

## Phase 1: Local Database (Room) ✅

- [x] **1.1**–**1.4** `User`, `ClassTemplate`, `Workout`, `WorkoutMetric` entities
- [x] **1.5** DAOs with leaderboard, PB, average and FTP queries
- [x] **1.6** `AppDatabase` singleton
- [x] **1.7** KSP processes Room annotations
- [x] **1.12** `workouts.is_complete` so a ride is recorded from the moment it starts (fixes the foreign key ordering that prevented all metric recording)
- [x] **1.13** Repository layer over the DAOs (`UserRepository`, `ClassRepository`, `WorkoutRepository`, `SettingsRepository`)

> **Note:** the database uses `fallbackToDestructiveMigration()` while pre-release. **Replace this with explicit migrations before the first real user installs a build** — after that, a schema change silently deletes their entire training history.

### Supabase (Cloud) ✅

- [x] **1.8** Supabase project created
- [x] **1.9** SQL migration in `supabase/migration.sql`
- [x] **1.10** Client provider, now null when unconfigured so the app is fully offline-capable
- [x] **1.11** Sync repository with **typed DTOs** (was `Map<String, Any?>`, which could not serialize)
- [x] **1.14** `SyncOutcome` distinguishes *disabled* from *failed*, so the worker knows what is worth retrying

---

## Phase 2: Telemetry Engine

**Goal:** Read real-time sensor data from the Peloton sensor board (serial) and BLE HR monitors.

### 2.1 Serial port
- [x] `SerialSensorSource` as a cold flow — collection opens the port, cancellation closes it
- [x] Removed the `close()` → `reconnect()` → `close()` cycle that made ending a workout start an endless retry loop
- [x] Device path injectable (docs said `/dev/ttyS1`, code opened `/dev/ttyS2`)
- [ ] **2.1.3** Verify against real hardware — *blocked on bike access*

### 2.2 Protocol parsing
- [x] `SerialProtocolParser` as a pure, testable state machine
- [x] Carries partial commands across read boundaries (a trailing `R` used to lose its value byte)
- [x] `CadenceTracker` smooths jitter and **decays to zero when pedalling stops** (cadence used to freeze at its last value forever)
- [ ] **2.2.4** Validate `PowerModel` coefficients against a known Grupetto curve or a real power meter. **Absolute watts are currently not trustworthy** — they are self-consistent between your own rides only.

### 2.3 BLE heart rate
- [x] Rewritten against the Bluetooth SIG spec: real Context, CCCD descriptor write, service-UUID scan filter, cancellable scanning, bounds-checked parsing
- [x] Runtime permission handling across API 24–34
- [x] `HeartRateStatus` surfaced in Settings
- [ ] **2.3.5** Verify with a real strap — *needs hardware*

### 2.4 Sensor repository
- [x] Unified `StateFlow<SensorReading>` merging bike telemetry and heart rate
- [x] **One** reconnect policy with exponential backoff (there were previously three competing ones)
- [x] Hardware mode retries rather than falling back to simulation, so a ride never records fabricated numbers

### 2.5 Metrics calculator
- [x] Total output by integrating power over **elapsed time**
- [x] Rolling averages over time windows
- [x] Cumulative distance estimation
- [x] Long sample gaps clamped so a backgrounded app cannot integrate idle time

### 2.6 Simulated source ✅
- [x] `SimulatedSensorSource` producing a plausible effort profile with lagging heart rate
- [x] Settings toggle: Auto / Hardware / Simulated
- [x] Ride screen states plainly when telemetry is simulated

---

## Phase 3: Foreground Service & Workout Lifecycle ✅

- [x] **3.1** `WorkoutService` with persistent notification and bound state
- [x] **3.2** Immutable `WorkoutSession` (in-place mutation plus `copy()` was being conflated away by `StateFlow`)
- [x] **3.3** `startWorkout` / `pauseWorkout` / `resumeWorkout` / `stopWorkout`
- [x] **3.4** Per-second metric recording, batched — **now actually works** (see Corrections)
- [x] **3.5** Notification channel and live metrics, with a real app icon
- [x] **3.6** Elapsed time from `SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()` rather than a drifting counter
- [x] **3.7** Pause time excluded from elapsed

---

## Phase 4: Floating HUD Overlay (WindowManager)

- [x] **4.1** `OverlayPermissionHelper`, with status shown in Settings
- [x] **4.2** `HudOverlayManager` using `TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY` / `TYPE_PHONE`
- [x] **4.3** Lifecycle, saved-state and ViewModelStore owners for the ComposeView
- [x] **4.4** Drag-to-move, scoped to the handle so it cannot swallow button presses
- [x] **4.6** Composition disposed on hide (each ride used to leak one)
- [x] **4.7** Fixed the `view.context as Activity` cast that threw `ClassCastException` from the overlay's Service context — the HUD crashed every time it was shown
- [x] **4.5** The overlay is raised when a ride starts and dropped when it ends
- [x] **4.8** Docked full-width to one screen edge rather than floating: the rider is watching something else, and the middle of the screen has to stay clear
- [x] **4.9** `WorkoutService` owns the overlay, not the ride screen's ViewModel — a ride outlives the screen, which is the entire point of the HUD

---

## Phase 5: HUD Compose UI & Power Zone Engine ✅

- [x] **5.1** HUD theme
- [x] **5.2** `MetricCard` with animated transitions
- [x] **5.3** Target zone indicator with out-of-range alerting
- [x] **5.4** ~~Collapsible leaderboard panel~~ — **removed in the HUD redesign.** It was built for a 300dp floating card and has no home on a full-width edge strip whose whole purpose is to stay out of the way. `WorkoutRepository.leaderboardFor` still exists and is still correct; nothing renders it. Tracked as 11.6 rather than left as a silently-broken tick.
- [x] **5.5** HUD controls — a single pause/resume toggle rather than two buttons, one always a no-op
- [x] **5.6** Assembled HUD content, using theme colours rather than hardcoded constants
- [x] **5.7** `PowerZone` with contiguous zone bands
- [x] **5.8** `RideIntent` as a typed enum (was a bare display string a typo could silently defeat)
- [x] **5.9** Zone alerting, suppressed when the rider is stationary

---

## Phase 6: Main App UI ✅

- [x] **6.1** `ProfileSelectorScreen` with adaptive grid and distinct guest treatment
- [x] **6.2** `ProfileCreationDialog`
- [x] **6.3** `MainDashboardScreen` — now showing **real** statistics
- [x] **6.4** `PreRideIntentPrompt` describing each option's actual effect
- [x] **6.5** `ClassLibraryScreen` with working category filters
- [x] **6.6** `ClassDetailScreen` — interval breakdown **now renders** (see Corrections)
- [x] **6.7** `PostRideSummaryScreen` reading real figures from the database
- [x] **6.8** `SettingsScreen` — FTP, weight, theme, telemetry source, BLE, overlay permission, cloud sync, all persisted
- [x] **6.9** Navigation via `NavHost` with typed destinations; ride screens are real destinations rather than booleans checked before the graph
- [x] **6.10** ViewModels with `StateFlow`; no database access from composables

---

## Phase 7: Auto-FTP Engine, Workload JSON & Cloud Sync ✅

- [x] **7.1** `PostWorkoutAnalyzer` — 20-min peak (O(n) sliding window over full-length windows only), biometric decoupling, RPE survey
- [x] **7.2** `FtpBreakthroughDialog`
- [x] **7.3** FTP update flow writing through to the profile
- [x] **7.4** `WorkoutSyncWorker` with a network constraint, retry ceiling, unique work, and a result it actually reads
- [x] **7.5** `ClassTemplateSeeder` listing the assets directory rather than a hardcoded category list
- [x] **7.6** Class template JSON in `assets/classes/`
- [x] **7.7** Seeding moved to application scope (a `LaunchedEffect` was cancelled by navigation mid-seed)

---

## Phase 8: Polish, Testing & Edge Cases

- [x] **8.1** Serial disconnection handled with a single backoff policy
- [x] **8.2** BLE disconnection handled without self-triggered reconnect loops
- [x] **8.3** Crash recovery via `is_complete`, surfaced through `WorkoutService.recoverableWorkout`
- [x] **8.3a** Recovery prompt shown at launch, driven from `AppViewModel` rather than the service. It offers to **keep** the ride, not resume it: the rider stopped pedalling when the app went away, and restarting the clock would splice a gap of unknown length into the record. `WorkoutAggregates` rebuilds the totals from the samples that did land.
- [x] **8.4** Guest post-ride: file against an existing profile, create one on the spot, keep as a household guest ride, or discard
- [x] **8.5** Haptic feedback for interval alerts — **and the `VIBRATE` permission it needs**
- [x] **8.6** TTS audio cues, with navigation-guidance audio attributes so the rider's video ducks under them
- [x] **8.6a** `RideCoach` wired into the ride, driven by the pure `RideCoachPolicy`. Replaces `ZoneAlertManager`, which had no caller and no decision logic to call it with.
- [x] **8.7** Unit tests: `PowerZone`, `PostWorkoutAnalyzer`, `WorkoutMetricsCalculator`, `RideIntent`, `SerialProtocolParser`, `CadenceTracker`, `PowerModel`, BLE parsing, `IntervalParser`, `ClassIntervalEngine`, `TargetBand`, `RideCoachPolicy`, `WorkoutAggregates` — **153 tests**
- [x] **8.8** Instrumented tests for Room DAOs (foreign key ordering, `is_complete` filtering, cascade delete)
- [x] **8.8a** Instrumented test for `WorkoutService` lifecycle — start/pause/resume/stop, the workout row existing before its first metric, the batched tail being flushed, and a finished ride no longer being offered for recovery
- [ ] **8.9** Manual testing on Gen 1/Gen 2 Peloton hardware — *blocked*
- [x] **8.12** Verified end-to-end on an emulator: profile creation → class library → intervals → simulated ride → post-ride summary → persisted metrics
- [x] **8.13** Verified on a 1920×1080 landscape tablet emulator, which is the shape of the device this actually runs on

### 8.11 Material Expressive design

- [x] **8.11.0** Inter variable font (SIL OFL)
- [x] **8.11.1–8.11.3** Colour tokens, light/dark schemes, fitness metric palette
- [x] **8.11.4–8.11.6** Elevation, shape and motion tokens — **deduplicated**; there were two conflicting elevation scales and a shape scale that shadowed itself with literal-named tokens
- [x] **8.11.7–8.11.11** Theme wired to `MaterialTheme.shapes` so stock components use it
- [x] **8.11.11a** Dynamic colour made opt-in — it previously overrode the entire palette on API 31+, making the brand theme dead code on any modern device
- [x] **8.11.13** Fade-through screen transitions
- [x] **8.11.17** Dashboard redesign
- [x] **8.11.27–8.11.29** Class library with filter chips and duration badges
- [x] **8.11.32/34** Class detail with zone-coloured interval cards
- [x] **8.11.37–8.11.38** Intent prompt with descriptions
- [x] **8.11.48/50** Post-ride summary cards and RPE selector (now a `FlowRow` — ten 48dp buttons in a `Row` overflowed every phone screen, making the higher ratings untappable)
- [x] **8.11.52** FTP breakthrough dialog
- [x] **8.11.65–8.11.67** Content descriptions, 48dp touch targets, semantic headings
- [x] **8.11.81** Shape as a semantic channel: the zone badge is a circle at Zone 1 and a twelve-point star at Zone 7, morphing between them on a change. Built on `androidx.graphics.shapes`, which is the mechanism behind Material 3 Expressive's shape language and works without moving to the material3 alpha.
- [x] **8.11.82** Off-target is amber, never red — power's own accent is coral, and a coral number turning red is not a signal anyone can read at a glance. The direction is also spelled out beside the label, so colour is never the only channel.
- [x] **8.11.83** Springy, physical motion: interval changes wash the HUD with the new zone's colour, cards overshoot and settle, the countdown re-bounces on every tick
- [ ] **8.11.12** Shared element transitions between profile selector and dashboard
- [ ] **8.11.14** Container transform for library → detail
- [ ] **8.11.15** Predictive back for Android 14+
- [ ] **8.11.16** Navigation rail or bottom bar
- [ ] **8.11.18** Large expressive FAB for Just Ride
- [ ] **8.11.21** Dashboard skeleton loading states
- [ ] **8.11.30–8.11.31** Class search bar, empty-state illustrations
- [ ] **8.11.33/35/36** Sticky class header, start-button loading state, difficulty indicator
- [ ] **8.11.39–8.11.41** Preparation checklist, sensor status, countdown
- [ ] **8.11.42–8.11.47** HUD redesign: progress arcs, blur pause overlay, expressive alerts
- [ ] **8.11.49/51** Achievement badges, share button
- [ ] **8.11.53–8.11.57** Charts: power with zone overlay, heart rate, cadence distribution, PB comparison
- [ ] **8.11.58–8.11.64** Extract the remaining shared components (`ZoneBadge`, `ProgressArc`, `SkeletonLoader`)
- [ ] **8.11.68–8.11.69** High contrast mode, font scaling
- [ ] **8.11.70–8.11.80** Micro-interactions, shimmer, pull-to-refresh, scroll edge effects

> The unticked items above are cosmetic and none of them are on the HUD. Phase
> 11 is worth more than all of them: the app runs a class now, and the question
> is whether the surface the rider actually spends forty minutes glancing at is
> good enough. Charts and shimmer are for the two minutes either side of that.

---

## Phase 9: Ride Integration — the current priority

**Goal:** Make a class actually run. Today a ride records telemetry and totals, but the class's own intervals do nothing and the floating HUD never appears.

### 9.1 Service lifecycle ✅
- [x] **9.1.1** Ride start launches `WorkoutService` as a foreground service with user, class, intent and FTP
- [x] **9.1.2** `RideViewModel` binds to the service and observes `workoutState` and `currentSession`
- [x] **9.1.3** End Ride stops the service and passes the real workout id to the summary

### 9.2 HUD overlay activation ✅
- [x] **9.2.1** `HudOverlayManager.show()` when a ride starts, `hide()` when it ends
- [x] **9.2.2** The service publishes one `RideSnapshot` the overlay renders from; telemetry stays on its own higher-rate flow so a sensor packet does not recompose the whole strip
- [x] **9.2.3** The overlay's pause/resume/stop drive the service directly
- [x] **9.2.4** Overlay permission asked for at ride start, with "not now" and "don't use the HUD" both honoured
- [x] **9.2.5** The overlay stands down while the app's own ride screen is on top, so the rider never sees two of everything

### 9.3 Class interval engine ✅
- [x] **9.3.1** `ClassIntervalEngine` over `List<Interval>` — a pure function of elapsed time, evaluated on the service's existing ticker rather than running a second clock that would drift away from it
- [x] **9.3.2** `IntervalState`: current and next interval, index, elapsed and remaining, class progress, cue
- [x] **9.3.3** Drives the target gauges on both the HUD and the ride screen
- [x] **9.3.4** The ride finishes itself when the class timer runs out

### 9.3a Interval preview & countdown ✅
- [x] **9.3a.1** `next` on `IntervalState`, null on the final interval by design
- [x] **9.3a.2** The interval clock is a draining progress ring around the zone badge, prominent on every interval rather than only recovery ones
- [x] **9.3a.3** Preview card with the next interval's zone colour, shape, cadence target and length
- [x] **9.3a.4** Five-second warning: the edge hairline thickens and pulses in the next zone's colour, the preview card scales up into a countdown, the strip washes with the new zone's colour, and a haptic fires on each tick
- [x] **9.3a.5** "Give it everything" on the last *hard* interval, "Cool down — ride easy" on a recovery finish, no next-interval preview on the final interval

### 9.4 Sensor data off-hardware ✅
- [x] **9.4.1** `SimulatedSensorProvider`
- [x] **9.4.2** Settings toggle between real and simulated input
- [x] **9.4.3** Graceful fallback when `/dev/ttyS2` is unavailable

### 9.5 Post-ride data flow ✅
- [x] **9.5.1** Final session collected from the service
- [x] **9.5.2** Real duration, average power, output and distance shown in the summary
- [x] **9.5.3** `PostWorkoutAnalyzer` run for FTP breakthrough detection
- [x] **9.5.4** `WorkoutSyncWorker` enqueued when a ride with a profile is saved, and when a guest ride is later filed against one

---

## Phase 11: The HUD-first experience — the current priority

**Premise:** this app is used almost entirely from the corner of the rider's
eye. They start a class, switch to Netflix, and look at Pelonot in glances for
the next forty minutes. The HUD is not an accessory to the ride screen; it *is*
the product, and everything in this phase is judged by whether it survives
being read in half a second from two metres away while out of breath.

### 11.1 Verify the HUD's own interactions on a device
- [x] **11.1.1** Docked strip renders over another app without covering the middle of the screen
- [x] **11.1.2** Sits below the status bar rather than under the clock
- [ ] **11.1.3** Tap-to-collapse and the slim strip it collapses to
- [ ] **11.1.4** Drag to re-dock between top and bottom, and that the choice persists
- [ ] **11.1.5** Pause, resume and stop from the HUD with the app in the background
- [ ] **11.1.6** Spoken coach mode actually audible over a playing video (needs a device with a TTS voice installed)

### 11.2 What the strip is still missing
- [x] **11.2.1** Resistance, with a prescribed range derived by inverting `PowerModel` at the middle of the cadence target. Shown next to cadence — the two inputs together, then the two outputs. Reports *no* band rather than a clamped percentage when the target is out of the knob's reach at that cadence, because the honest instruction there is "spin faster".
- [ ] **11.2.1a** The resistance band disappears on some Zone 1 intervals for a low-FTP rider: the unloaded curve at 85 rpm already produces more watts than the whole zone allows. That is arguably *true* and worth saying out loud ("you cannot ride this easy at this cadence") rather than saying nothing. Blocked behind 2.2.4 — until the curve is calibrated it is as likely to be a modelling artefact as a real contradiction.
- [ ] **11.2.2** Time in zone: a thin stacked bar of how the ride has been spent, for the collapsed strip where the timeline does not fit
- [ ] **11.2.3** A "you are ahead of / behind your usual" line against `leaderboardFor`, which is the one comparison a rider actually acts on mid-ride
- [ ] **11.2.4** Handle a HUD raised while a call or another overlay is on top

### 11.3 Beyond the strip
- [ ] **11.3.1** Landscape layouts for the profile selector and dashboard — both are phone-shaped columns with two thirds of a 1920×1080 screen empty
- [ ] **11.3.2** Post-ride charts: power with zone bands, heart rate, cadence distribution (8.11.53–8.11.57)
- [ ] **11.3.3** Time-in-zone summary on the post-ride screen
- [ ] **11.3.4** Skip or extend the current interval mid-ride, for a rider who needs to take a call
- [ ] **11.3.5** Screen-on lock during a ride, so the tablet does not sleep mid-class

### 11.4 Re-home the leaderboard
- [ ] **11.4.1** Leaderboard on the post-ride summary, where there is room for it
- [ ] **11.4.2** A single-line "vs your best" on the ride screen (not the HUD)

---

## Phase 10: Hardware Validation — blocked

Everything here needs a jailbroken Gen 1/Gen 2 bike.

- [ ] **10.1** Confirm the sensor board's device path and that it is readable
- [ ] **10.2** Confirm the byte protocol matches `SerialProtocolParser` (`C` ticks, `R`+value)
- [ ] **10.3** Calibrate `PowerModel` against a known-good power source — see 2.2.4
- [ ] **10.4** Verify the HUD renders over the Peloton video app
- [ ] **10.5** Verify a BLE strap connects and streams
- [ ] **10.6** Full-length ride: battery, thermals, memory, no dropped samples

---

## Quick Reference: Coggan 7-Zone Power Model

Bounds are **contiguous and half-open** (`lower ≤ pct < upper`). The published table quotes whole percentages, which leaves unassigned gaps between zones; modelling those literally means a rider at 55.5% of FTP matches no zone at all.

| Zone | Name | % of FTP | Training purpose |
|------|------|----------|------------------|
| Z1 | Active Recovery | < 56% | Warmup, cooldown |
| Z2 | Endurance | 56–76% | Aerobic base |
| Z3 | Tempo | 76–91% | Aerobic efficiency |
| Z4 | Lactate Threshold | 91–106% | Sustainable hard effort |
| Z5 | VO2 Max | 106–121% | Max oxygen uptake |
| Z6 | Anaerobic Capacity | 121–151% | Short power bursts |
| Z7 | Neuromuscular Power | ≥ 151% | Explosive sprints |

## Quick Reference: Ride Intent

`P_target = FTP × zone% × k`

| Intent | `k` | Effect |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Reach New Milestones | 1.05 | Targets 5% higher |
| Just Stay Fit | 0.95 | Targets 5% lower |
