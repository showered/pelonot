# Pelonot — Implementation Plan

> **Open-Source Peloton Client** — A subscription-free fitness app for Peloton
> bikes (Gen 1/Gen 2). **A stock, un-jailbroken bike is the supported target**;
> telemetry comes from Peloton's own sensor service, not from root (see 2.1a).

## How to use this plan

1. **Each checkbox is one focused task** — small enough for a single session, large enough to matter.
2. **A box is only ticked when the behaviour has been observed working**, not when the code was written. Several items in this plan were previously ticked while the feature was non-functional (see [plan/corrections.md](plan/corrections.md)); that is the failure mode this rule exists to prevent.
3. **Work phases in order** where later ones build on earlier ones. See *Where the work stands* immediately below for the current priority.
4. When switching models or sessions, paste the current plan state so the next session knows where to pick up.

## The owner's inbox — ideas between sessions

**The owner writes here directly, without opening a session.** It is a way of
handing over a thought at the moment of having it rather than at the moment of
being able to act on it: an idea does not have to wait for a prompt, and it does
not have to interrupt work already in flight. One heading per idea.

**How a session handles it.** Read this section before picking work. What is in
it is the owner speaking, and it outranks the *What to do next* ordering below.
Take an entry, decide where in the plan it belongs, write it up as numbered
items with the reasoning kept rather than summarised — and then **empty the
entry out of this section**. An idea still sitting here has not been dealt with;
an idea that has moved has.

*Empty. The one entry it has held so far — standing and seated riding — is now
**Phase 25**, which is built but for one judgement that needs a rider (25.3.4).
The owner's answer on 25.4.2, left in the phase file rather than here, was
acted on in the fifteenth sitting and is written up there.*

## Where the rest of this plan lives

**This file is the index.** It holds the owner's inbox, where the work stands,
what to do next and the status table — the things every session reads. The
phases themselves live in `plan/`, one file each, so a session can open the two
it needs instead of sixty thousand tokens of everything.

Item numbers are unchanged and still the way to refer to anything: **2.7c**,
**11.1b.9**, **24.3.1** mean what they always did, and the table says which
file to open for each.

**Adding to the plan:** put the item in its phase's file. Only the four
sections of *this* file move with each session — the inbox, the latest sitting,
*What to do next*, and the status table. When a sitting's narrative stops being
the latest, it goes to the top of `plan/session-log.md`.

## Where the work stands — read this first

### Latest session — 2 August 2026 (fifteenth sitting): four items, and a query the bike answered on its own

No rider, and none needed. The tablet AVD for everything with a screen, and
**the bike's own database for the one question that had been waiting on
hardware** — which turned out not to need a rider at all, only 1,661 rows that
were already there. Closed: **25.4.2**, **16.3.1 / 7.10.1**, **14.4** (with
14.4.6, the item it was blocked behind) and **23.3.1**. 443 JVM tests, 0
failures. Three new items came out of it and one of those is the owner's.

**The owner answered 25.4.2 in the plan file: rename them.** `END-08` was
called "Seated Climbs 45" and not one block in it said *seated* — the same
defect 25.1 opened with, pointed the other way round. R11's half-a-class cap
was never the thing that was wrong and has not been touched. **It was four
classes rather than three**, because auditing the titles turned up `END-12`
doing the same at Z2, and an audit is only worth having if it is finished. The
rule the four leave behind is in `classlibrary/README.md` under R10: **a
position word in a title is a promise that the blocks say it too** — and "big
gear" is a position word, because in cycling usage it means seated torque and a
rider reads it as the instruction. `SWT-09` "Big Gear / Fast Legs 45" keeps its
name, since its big-gear blocks really are marked `SEATED`. The new names come
off the axis the data does carry: *Tempo Climbs 5×5*, *Climb and Spin*, *Low
Cadence Sweet Spot*, *Low Cadence Threshold 4×4* — which is also what the rest
of the industry calls them. A rename is safe where 23.2.6's rebuild had to take
new ids, because the title is not the foreign key.

**The FTP trend got the screen it had been waiting for (16.3.1 / 7.10.1).** The
dashboard card answers *where is it now*; this answers *how did it get here*.
Two decisions are about honesty rather than drawing. **A mark per change says
how the app came to believe it** — filled where it measured the value off a
ride, hollow where the rider typed it, which is the distinction
`FtpChangeSource`'s own documentation opens with, drawn rather than described;
`PulledFromCloud` is hollow too, because another device's arithmetic is not
this bike's measurement. And **the first value is not a change**: it is where
the number began, so it has no mark and no row. The third came out of looking
at it — **the axis runs to *now*, not to the last change**, because stopping on
the day of the last change says the record ends there when the flat run to the
edge is the rider's answer to "how long have I been at this".

**Then 14.4, which had a precondition, and the precondition is the interesting
part.** 14.4.6 said settle the `getFloat().toDouble()` question first: if the
board reports fractional values, the noise digits are in the payload, the
charts, the exports and the calibration grid. It has been sitting there marked
as needing the bike — and it needed the bike only in the sense that the bike
was already holding the answer. One `sqlite3` query over 1,661 recorded rows:

- **The board does report fractional power and the digits are real.** Tenths of
  a watt, off the `0x44` frame. 1,360 of the rows are fractional.
- **The noise the finding feared existed and had already been fixed.**
  `29.2000007629395` is `29.2f` widened, and it appears only in the three rides
  recorded *before* 2.7c — the fix that made the frame decide the metric also
  took the value off `getFloat()`. Nothing is rewritten; those rides are
  already marked suspect by 2.7.5.
- **Cadence and resistance are integral in every row**, which turned out to be
  worth 11 KB a ride.

That last one is why the payload landed where the storage budget said it would.
The first columnar draft measured **64 KB**, not 49 — `80.0` is two characters
more than `80`, across three columns and 2,700 samples. `CompactDouble` writes
a whole number without its decimal, which is not a rounding, and the round-trip
test now reports **49 KB against 228 KB** with both shapes built from the same
samples. The version went **inside** the payload rather than in a column beside
it, against the item's wording: a column and the JSON it describes are written
by different code and can drift, and a version that disagrees with its payload
is worse than none.

**And the backup reminder (23.3.1), which is a design problem disguised as a
feature.** The hard half is not knowing when to speak, it is knowing when not
to. It counts **rides, not days** — a rider off the bike for a fortnight has
lost nothing since their last backup; time passing is not risk. **"Not now"
moves the line rather than silencing it**, one mark serving both a backup and a
dismissal because the reminder only asks one question. And **never having
backed up does not lower the bar**, because a rider three rides in has nothing
to lose yet and an app that opens with a warning is one whose warnings are gone
by the day they matter. The mark is written only on success: recording a failed
backup would tell the rider they are safe on precisely the day they are not.

Three items opened. **25.4.3** — the rename put `SWT-05` and `THR-06` in the
same words and made visible that they are nearly the same class, identical work
differing only in the recovery, which is a small version of what 23.2.6 was
complaining about. **14.4.7** — the new payload drops `power_is_measured`, the
one thing it does not carry, and `PowerProvenance` gates real decisions.
**23.3.1a** — cloud backup is per profile and the backup file is per tablet,
which nobody has to answer until Phase 15 exists.

### Still needing a rider on the bike

- ~~**2.7.1b / 2.7.1c**~~ — **done, 1 August 2026.** Root cause found and the
  fix verified on the bike; see 2.7c. Two things worth carrying from how it
  went: the whole diagnosis needed **90 seconds of pedalling in total**,
  because the decisive captures were all taken with the rider stationary
  (resistance polls regardless, and a non-zero cadence with nobody pedalling is
  unmistakable evidence); and **this tablet has `log.tag=W` set globally**, so
  three attempts produced no output at all until per-tag levels were raised.
- **10.6** — a full-length ride (battery, thermals, memory, dropped samples).
- **2.2a.1** — watch a Hardware-mode ride actually land in the calibration
  grid. Everything downstream of it is written and tested; nothing has seen the
  accumulation happen. Settings → *This bike's power curve* reports it.
- **11.5.2** — whether the coach volume slider audibly does anything.
  `com.onepeloton.tts` is the only engine this ever runs against.
- **11.5.8** — ten seconds of `getevent -l` to settle whether the tablet has
  volume keys at all.
- **25.3.4** — how the stand/sit cue reads over a *playing film*. The AVD shows
  everything except that, because `screencap` returns black over DRM.
- **14.1.6 / 14.4.5** — neither needs the bike; both need one query against the
  cloud. Note 14.4.5 now measures the *old* payload shape, since the single row
  up there predates 14.4.

**One came off this list without a rider, and it is worth remembering why.**
14.4.6 sat here as a hardware question for a fortnight. It was a question about
data the bike had *already recorded* — 1,661 rows, answerable by pulling the
database over adb while nobody was near the bike. Before adding something here,
check whether the bike is holding the answer already.

### What to do next, in order

**Everything below is reordered by the first real ride, 1 August 2026.** The
triage is the owner's snag list plus what the ride measured.

**Still first, but no longer stop-everything — the fence and the watchdog
landed in the tenth sitting and nothing impossible reaches the record now:**

| Next | Why now |
|------|---------|
| ~~**2.7.1b** Which side mislabels the stream~~ | **Done — root cause found and fixed, verified on the bike.** `msg.what` is assigned by position and slides; the frame in `responseHexString` is self-identifying and now decides the metric. Read **2.7c**. What is left of 2.7 is 2.7.7 / 2.7.8, from the serial-port leak underneath it (2.7d) |
| ~~**2.7.5** What to do about the rides already recorded~~ | **Done and observed on the bike's own database.** Marked, not rewritten: three corrupted rides found, the fourth (post-fix) clean. Read 2.7.5 |
| ~~**2.7.3** A plausibility fence~~ | Done and observed: 0 impossible values in 188 recorded samples across a ride carrying 30 s of the bike's own corruption signature |
| ~~**2.7.4** Telemetry dies and never recovers~~ | Done and observed: silence is an `IOException` now, the one retry policy rebuilds the source, and the ride picked up again at 122 s with no app restart |

**Then the ride-screen snags, which are what the owner actually feels:**

| Next | Why now |
|------|---------|
| ~~**11.6.7** The numbers change too fast to read~~ | **Done and observed.** `SensorRepository.displayReading`, 2 Hz, both surfaces, recorder untouched |
| ~~**11.6.8** The zone ladder shifts sideways~~ | **Done and observed.** Not the border — the zone name and the FTP percentage sized themselves to their own text. Both now reserve their widest string |
| ~~**11.6.9 / 11.6.10** The heart-rate dead end, and Settings mid-ride~~ | **Done and observed.** A sheet over the ride, a gear beside the telemetry chip, and the overlay's way in inside the volume panel. One snag found and left open — see the end of 11.6.10 |
| ~~**16.1.7 / 16.1.8** Axes on the charts~~ | **Done and observed.** `ChartScale` picks the round numbers, `ChartFrame` draws them for every trace |
| ~~**13.8** kg/lb at signup~~ | **Done and observed.** The old dialog stored a 77 kg rider as 34.9 kg |

**Then the substantial ones:**

| Next | Why now |
|------|---------|
| ~~**23.2.6** Rebuild the class library~~ | **Done and observed.** Designed rather than sliced: 20 block lengths against 101, 51 zone sequences against 12, cadence a real second axis. New id series, old ones retired rather than deleted (23.2.6c). Read `classlibrary/README.md` before touching a class |
| ~~**22.2.6** Width cap as a rule~~ | **Done and observed.** `Layout.readableWidth` + `Modifier.readableColumn()`, applied to Settings, History, ride detail and the class library |
| ~~**25.3** The overlay's stand/sit cue~~ | **Built and observed on the AVD.** Amber lozenge, arrow travelling in the direction of the instruction, six seconds and gone; driven by `PositionCallTracker`, which the spoken coach now asks too. **25.3.4 is still open and needs the owner** — how it reads over a *film* cannot be screenshotted (`FLAG_SECURE`) |
| ~~**25.4.1** Positions across the rest of the library~~ | **Done — an audit, and one block wanted one.** It also turned up 25.4.2, below |
| ~~**25.4.2** Three classes named after a position they cannot state~~ | **Done — the owner chose renaming, and it was four classes, not three.** R11's cap is untouched; `END-08`, `END-12`, `SWT-05` and `THR-06` are named off the axis the data carries. The rule it leaves behind is in `classlibrary/README.md` under R10: **a position word in a title is a promise that the blocks say it too**, and "big gear" is a position word. It opened **25.4.3** |
| ~~**24.2** The household, seen~~ | **Done and observed**, opt-out included |
| ~~**24.3.1** Riding against a housemate~~ | **Done and observed.** One query and no schema, as advertised. **24.3.2** — the live pace target *during* a ride — is the interesting half and is still open; read 11.6 first |
| ~~**7.8 / 7.9** The FTP a ride was ridden at, and FTP history~~ | **Both done and observed.** `workouts.ftp_watts` (migration 6→7) and `ftp_history` (7→8, seeded from the profiles that already exist). 16.3 is unblocked. Between them they found a live bug: **saving your FTP in Settings put the old one back**, invisibly, because a second coroutine carried a stale copy past it |
| ~~**16.3.1 / 7.10.1** The full FTP trend~~ | **Done and observed.** The screen it wanted exists — *Your FTP*, off the dashboard's card — with a mark per change that says whether the app measured it or the rider claimed it, and the ride behind each one a tap away. Read 7.10.1 for why the axis runs to *now* |
| **23.2.3 / 23.2.4** The class library as an update channel | The only remaining reason to read the cloud at all. Additive only — deleting a class takes a rider's history link with it |
| ~~**14.4** The payload format~~ | **Done, and the numbers are measured now rather than modelled: 228 KB → 49 KB** per ride, asserted in the round trip against the old shape built from the same samples. It also settled **14.4.6** off the bike's own database with no rider: the board's fractional power is real data, and the float-widening noise it feared went away with 2.7c. 14.4.5 still wants the cloud trip; **14.4.7** is new — the payload drops `power_is_measured` |
| ~~**23.3.1** The backup reminder~~ | **Done and observed.** Ten rides, counted across the whole tablet because the file is; "Not now" moves the line rather than silencing it; and the mark is written only when a backup actually succeeds. **23.3.1a** is new and belongs to Phase 15: cloud backup is per profile and the file is per tablet |

One of the owner's own is still open and unchanged:

| Next | Why now |
|------|---------|
| **11.1b.10** The grey line on the overlay | Diagnosed, not decided. One of three candidate fixes, and picking is the owner's call — read the item |

Then the table below, which was written before the fifth sitting and is kept
because its reasoning is still good:

| Next | Why now |
|------|---------|
| **14.1.6** Finish the cloud round trip | **Blocked as of the ninth sitting, and deliberately.** The app can no longer make the call: nothing sets `auth_user_id`, so every profile is offline and every cloud method returns `Disabled`. The row that was posted in the seventh sitting is still up there unseen; seeing it needs one `select count(*) from workouts` through the Management API, and *re-driving* it needs Phase 15 or the column set by hand |
| **11.1b.3 / 11.1b.4** Resizing and side docking | The half of 11.1b still outstanding. Opacity and the two-band layout landed; a vertical dock down one side is probably the better default on a 16:9 tablet and needs a genuine re-flow, not a rotation |
| **11.2.2 / 11.2.3** Time in zone, and "ahead of your usual" | The two things still missing from the strip that are about the next sixty seconds |
| **11.1b.9** The chips as a piece of design | The HUD redesign is correct and not yet beautiful, and the owner has said he will come back to it. Read 11.1b.8 and 11.1b.4a first — they are the same conversation |

Still blocked on things not to hand: **10.6** needs a full-length ride, and the
four bike items listed above.

Two notes worth carrying into the next bike session:

- **The dashboard is fine in landscape** — re-confirmed on the matching AVD this
  session. It fills the width and shows none of the empty right-hand side
  11.3.1 describes. **11.3.1 is stale**; do not spend a session on it without
  re-checking first. (The sixth sitting then capped that width at 760 dp for a
  different reason — 22.2.1 — which does not contradict it: 11.3.1 is about
  dead space and 22.2.1 is about a card being too wide to read.)
- **Every ride is now a guest ride no longer**: the emulator has real profiles
  and the sync path runs for them. The tablet still has none, and a guest ride
  never syncs by design, so make a profile on the bike before expecting 14 to
  do anything there.

## Status at a glance

| Phase | Area | State |
|-------|------|-------|
| 0 | Scaffolding & build system | ✅ Complete |
| 1 | Local database (Room) + Supabase | 🔶 Room complete at schema version 3. The class library is bundled, not fetched (23.2), and the cloud is gated behind an account that nothing yet grants (23.1) |
| 2 | Telemetry engine (sensor service, BLE, simulated) | ✅ **2.7 solved and verified on the bike (2.7c).** The board's own frame decides the metric, so the service's positional `msg.what` can no longer mislabel anything; the raw-resistance intruder is dropped by identity. 1609 + 464 messages captured with zero mislabels, a recorded ride with zero impossible values and zero gaps. The three rides recorded before the fix are marked rather than rewritten (2.7.5). Open underneath it: the exclusive serial port leaks (2.7d → 2.7.7, 2.7.8) |
| 3 | Foreground service & workout lifecycle | ✅ Complete |
| 4 | Floating HUD overlay | ✅ **Exonerated.** It never corrupted anything: 464 messages captured with the overlay up and a rider pedalling, zero mislabels and zero dropouts (2.7c). What it correlated with was *leaving the app*, and on this tablet that can mean a second bike app taking the sensor's serial port (2.7d) |
| 5 | HUD Compose UI & power zones | ✅ Complete |
| 6 | Main app UI | ✅ Complete |
| 7 | Auto-FTP, workload JSON, cloud sync | 🔶 Detection, the update flow, **the FTP a ride was ridden at (7.8), the history of every change (7.9) and both ways of showing it — the dashboard card (7.10.2) and the full trend (7.10.1)** are complete and observed, and a simulated ride can no longer propose an FTP (7.10.7). What remains is reverting an auto change (7.10.4), not re-offering a declined one (7.10.5), the simulated-watts caveat on the trend (7.10.6) and whether any of it syncs (7.10.8) |
| 8 | Polish, testing, edge cases | 🔶 Functional items done; cosmetic backlog remains — **plus 8.3b, newly opened: the recovery prompt cannot tell a crashed ride from a live one** |
| 9 | Ride integration | ✅ Complete — a class runs |
| 10 | Hardware validation | 🔶 A **full 20-minute ride is done** — and it is what found 2.7. 10.6's remaining questions (battery, thermals, memory) are unanswered because the ride's telemetry was the story |
| 11 | **HUD-first experience — the current priority** | 🔶 11.1 and 11.1a complete; volume (11.5) done. The HUD is now chips on a transparent band with the timeline on the opposite edge (11.1b.1, 11.1b.2, 11.1b.7); resizing and side docking (11.1b.3–11.1b.5) and the rest of 11.2 remain |
| 12 | Ride history & the rider's own record | 🔶 History, detail, delete and migrations done; export and housekeeping remain |
| 13 | Units and display preferences | ✅ Complete — miles, and the locale default that goes with them |
| 14 | Cloud sync that actually reaches the cloud | 🔶 Built and now **gated shut** — every call goes through `CloudAccess` and no profile has an account, so nothing reaches the cloud until Phase 15 exists. 14.1.6's sighting is still missing and is no longer drivable from the app. **The payload format is changed (14.4)** while the cloud still held one row: columnar, versioned inside itself, 228 KB → 49 KB measured. What it drops is `power_is_measured` (14.4.7) |
| 15 | Accounts, login and multi-device sync | ❌ Not started — *the thing that unlocks the cloud tier*, and since the ninth sitting **the only thing that can**: `auth_user_id` exists, is the gate, and nothing sets it |
| 16 | Data visualisation | 🔶 Post-ride charts done, the power caption says where the watts came from (16.1.6), and every trace now carries a scale decided once for all four (16.1.7 / 16.1.8). **The first trend is built (16.3.1)** — FTP over time on its own screen, with the ride behind each change one tap away — which also settles where a trend lives. The other four (16.3.2–16.3.5) remain |
| 17 | Companion web application | ❌ Not started — *nice to have*, and account-tier only: a household-only profile does not exist in the cloud and never appears there |
| 18 | Social **across bikes** — the networked tier | ❌ Not started — *nice to have*, and it sits on 15. Phase 24 is the half that does not |
| 19 | Ideas worth having, ranked | ❌ Not started — mixed |
| 20 | Who's riding — profile selector & avatars | 🔶 Selector rebuilt for the tablet (20.1, incl. rename/remove); avatars (20.2) not started |
| 21 | Heart-rate zones | ❌ Not started — *the one metric that is measured for every rider whatever the power model does* |
| 22 | The dashboard | 🔶 **The FTP card is now a progress card (22.1.4)** — the number, a stepped sparkline of every value it has held, and how far it moved and who moved it. That is the first thing in the section that is a trend rather than a total; the two kJ cards below it are still what they were (22.1.2). The width cap is a theme token applied across the app rather than one screen's fix (22.2.6); what goes in the rails it opens up (22.2.2, 22.2.3) is still undecided |
| 23 | Offline by default — making the ungated tier complete | 🔶 **The consent gate (23.1), the class library (23.2) and the backup reminder (23.3.1) are done and observed** — rule 1 is true rather than intended, the 72 classes are designed rather than generated (23.2.6) and reach an already-seeded tablet by reconcile-and-retire (23.2.6c), and the offline rider is now told when ten rides have gone by unprotected. The cloud as an update channel (23.2.3/23.2.4) and retention (23.4, deliberately not yet) remain |
| 24 | Household social — the tier that needs no cloud | 🔶 **24.1, 24.2 and 24.3.1 built and observed** — the per-class board, the household's week with streaks and an opt-out, and a housemate's trace drawn behind your own on ride detail. What remains is **24.3.2**, the live pace target during a ride, which is a ride-screen design problem rather than a data one |
| 25 | Out of the saddle | 🔶 **The field, the ride screen, the spoken coach, the overlay's cue and the library's own use of it are done and observed (25.1–25.4.2).** The titles no longer claim a position the intervals do not give. What is left is how the cue reads over a playing film (25.3.4, needs the rider), and 25.4.3 — two classes the rename showed to be near-twins |
