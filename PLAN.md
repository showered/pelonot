# Pelonot — Implementation Plan

> **Open-Source Peloton Client** — A subscription-free fitness app for jailbroken Peloton bikes (Gen 1/Gen 2).

---

## How to use this plan

1. **Each checkbox is one focused task** — small enough for a single session, large enough to matter.
2. **A box is only ticked when the behaviour has been observed working**, not when the code was written. Several items in this plan were previously ticked while the feature was non-functional (see *Corrections* below); that is the failure mode this rule exists to prevent.
3. **Work phases in order** where later ones build on earlier ones. Phase 9 is the current priority.
4. When switching models or sessions, paste the current plan state so the next session knows where to pick up.

## Corrections — items previously ticked that were not working

Recorded so the same mistakes are not repeated, and because several of these
were the *reason* a downstream feature looked broken.

| Item | Was ticked | Reality |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 1.11 Supabase repository | ✅ | Passed `Map<String, Any?>` to kotlinx.serialization, which has no serializer for `Any`. Every call threw and was swallowed by `runCatching`. |
| 2.3 BLE heart rate | ✅ | `connectGatt(null, …)`; CCCD descriptor never written, so the strap was never asked to notify. No reading could ever arrive. |
| 2.5 Metrics calculator | ✅ | Integrated power against sample *count*, not elapsed time — a 45-minute ride over-reported energy by ~1000×. |
| 3.4 Per-second metric recording | ✅ | `workout_metrics` has a foreign key onto `workouts`, but the workout row was only written at ride *end*. Every insert violated the constraint. No ride ever stored a time series. |
| 5.7 Power zone calculator | ✅ | Zone ranges left gaps (0.55–0.56 etc.); a lookup that matched nothing fell through to Z7, so an easy warmup was reported as Neuromuscular Power. |
| 6.6 Class detail screen | ✅ | Interval model used camelCase field names against snake_case assets. Every decode threw and was caught into `emptyList()`. No class ever displayed an interval. |
| 8.3 Crash recovery | ✅ | `getIncompleteWorkout()` returned the most recent workout with no completion filter, so the app offered to resume the ride you had just finished, on every launch. |
| 8.7 Unit tests | ✅ | `PostWorkoutAnalyzerTest.kt` was committed empty. |
| 8.8 Instrumented tests | ✅ | `WorkoutDaoTest` referenced `localUserId` / `classTemplateId`, fields that never existed on the entity. It had never compiled. |
| 8.11.17 Dashboard redesign | ✅ | Shipped with `"12.5"` and `"8.3"` kJ hardcoded, and a constant "FTP Stable" badge, shown as the rider's own statistics. |

All of the above are now fixed and covered by tests.

## Phase 0: Project Scaffolding & Build System ✅

- [x] **0.1** Android project structure
- [x] **0.2** `minSdk 24`, `targetSdk 34`, `compileSdk 34`
- [x] **0.3** Dependencies wired (Compose, Material3, Room + KSP, Coroutines, Supabase, WorkManager, Navigation, Lifecycle, DataStore)
- [x] **0.4** `AndroidManifest.xml` with permissions
- [x] **0.5** `PelonotApp` application class
- [x] **0.6** Builds and runs
- [x] **0.7** Dependencies centralised in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`
- [x] **0.8** Supabase credentials moved out of source into `local.properties` → `BuildConfig`
- [x] **0.9** R8 enabled for release with kotlinx-serialization / Ktor / Room keep rules

---

## Phase 1: Local Database (Room) ✅

- [x] **1.1**–**1.4** `User`, `ClassTemplate`, `Workout`, `WorkoutMetric` entities
- [x] **1.5** DAOs with leaderboard, PB, average and FTP queries
- [x] **1.6** `AppDatabase` singleton
- [x] **1.7** KSP processes Room annotations
- [x] **1.12** `workouts.is_complete` so a ride is recorded from the moment it starts (fixes the foreign key ordering that prevented all metric recording)
- [x] **1.13** Repository layer over the DAOs (`UserRepository`, `ClassRepository`, `WorkoutRepository`, `SettingsRepository`)

> **Note:** the database uses `fallbackToDestructiveMigration()` while pre-release. **Replace this with explicit migrations before the first real user installs a build** — after that, a schema change silently deletes their entire training history.

### Supabase (Cloud) ✅

- [x] **1.8** Supabase project created
- [x] **1.9** SQL migration in `supabase/migration.sql`
- [x] **1.10** Client provider, now null when unconfigured so the app is fully offline-capable
- [x] **1.11** Sync repository with **typed DTOs** (was `Map<String, Any?>`, which could not serialize)
- [x] **1.14** `SyncOutcome` distinguishes *disabled* from *failed*, so the worker knows what is worth retrying

---

## Phase 2: Telemetry Engine

**Goal:** Read real-time sensor data from the Peloton sensor board (serial) and BLE HR monitors.

### 2.1 Serial port
- [x] `SerialSensorSource` as a cold flow — collection opens the port, cancellation closes it
- [x] Removed the `close()` → `reconnect()` → `close()` cycle that made ending a workout start an endless retry loop
- [x] Device path injectable (docs said `/dev/ttyS1`, code opened `/dev/ttyS2`)
- [ ] **2.1.3** Verify against real hardware — *blocked on bike access*

### 2.2 Protocol parsing
- [x] `SerialProtocolParser` as a pure, testable state machine
- [x] Carries partial commands across read boundaries (a trailing `R` used to lose its value byte)
- [x] `CadenceTracker` smooths jitter and **decays to zero when pedalling stops** (cadence used to freeze at its last value forever)
- [ ] **2.2.4** Validate `PowerModel` coefficients against a known Grupetto curve or a real power meter. **Absolute watts are currently not trustworthy** — they are self-consistent between your own rides only.

### 2.3 BLE heart rate
- [x] Rewritten against the Bluetooth SIG spec: real Context, CCCD descriptor write, service-UUID scan filter, cancellable scanning, bounds-checked parsing
- [x] Runtime permission handling across API 24–34
- [x] `HeartRateStatus` surfaced in Settings
- [ ] **2.3.5** Verify with a real strap — *needs hardware*

### 2.4 Sensor repository
- [x] Unified `StateFlow<SensorReading>` merging bike telemetry and heart rate
- [x] **One** reconnect policy with exponential backoff (there were previously three competing ones)
- [x] Hardware mode retries rather than falling back to simulation, so a ride never records fabricated numbers

### 2.5 Metrics calculator
- [x] Total output by integrating power over **elapsed time**
- [x] Rolling averages over time windows
- [x] Cumulative distance estimation
- [x] Long sample gaps clamped so a backgrounded app cannot integrate idle time

### 2.6 Simulated source ✅
- [x] `SimulatedSensorSource` producing a plausible effort profile with lagging heart rate
- [x] Settings toggle: Auto / Hardware / Simulated
- [x] Ride screen states plainly when telemetry is simulated

---

## Phase 3: Foreground Service & Workout Lifecycle ✅

- [x] **3.1** `WorkoutService` with persistent notification and bound state
- [x] **3.2** Immutable `WorkoutSession` (in-place mutation plus `copy()` was being conflated away by `StateFlow`)
- [x] **3.3** `startWorkout` / `pauseWorkout` / `resumeWorkout` / `stopWorkout`
- [x] **3.4** Per-second metric recording, batched — **now actually works** (see Corrections)
- [x] **3.5** Notification channel and live metrics, with a real app icon
- [x] **3.6** Elapsed time from `SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()` rather than a drifting counter
- [x] **3.7** Pause time excluded from elapsed

---

## Phase 4: Floating HUD Overlay (WindowManager)

- [x] **4.1** `OverlayPermissionHelper`, with status shown in Settings
- [x] **4.2** `HudOverlayManager` using `TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY` / `TYPE_PHONE`
- [x] **4.3** Lifecycle, saved-state and ViewModelStore owners for the ComposeView
- [x] **4.4** Drag-to-move, scoped to the handle so it cannot swallow button presses
- [x] **4.6** Composition disposed on hide (each ride used to leak one)
- [x] **4.7** Fixed the `view.context as Activity` cast that threw `ClassCastException` from the overlay's Service context — the HUD crashed every time it was shown
- [ ] **4.5** **Actually show the overlay when a ride starts** — nothing calls `show()` yet. See 9.2.

---

## Phase 5: HUD Compose UI & Power Zone Engine ✅

- [x] **5.1** HUD theme
- [x] **5.2** `MetricCard` with animated transitions
- [x] **5.3** Target zone indicator with out-of-range alerting
- [x] **5.4** Collapsible leaderboard panel
- [x] **5.5** HUD controls — a single pause/resume toggle rather than two buttons, one always a no-op
- [x] **5.6** Assembled HUD content, using theme colours rather than hardcoded constants
- [x] **5.7** `PowerZone` with contiguous zone bands
- [x] **5.8** `RideIntent` as a typed enum (was a bare display string a typo could silently defeat)
- [x] **5.9** Zone alerting, suppressed when the rider is stationary

---

## Phase 6: Main App UI ✅

- [x] **6.1** `ProfileSelectorScreen` with adaptive grid and distinct guest treatment
- [x] **6.2** `ProfileCreationDialog`
- [x] **6.3** `MainDashboardScreen` — now showing **real** statistics
- [x] **6.4** `PreRideIntentPrompt` describing each option's actual effect
- [x] **6.5** `ClassLibraryScreen` with working category filters
- [x] **6.6** `ClassDetailScreen` — interval breakdown **now renders** (see Corrections)
- [x] **6.7** `PostRideSummaryScreen` reading real figures from the database
- [x] **6.8** `SettingsScreen` — FTP, weight, theme, telemetry source, BLE, overlay permission, cloud sync, all persisted
- [x] **6.9** Navigation via `NavHost` with typed destinations; ride screens are real destinations rather than booleans checked before the graph
- [x] **6.10** ViewModels with `StateFlow`; no database access from composables

---

## Phase 7: Auto-FTP Engine, Workload JSON & Cloud Sync ✅

- [x] **7.1** `PostWorkoutAnalyzer` — 20-min peak (O(n) sliding window over full-length windows only), biometric decoupling, RPE survey
- [x] **7.2** `FtpBreakthroughDialog`
- [x] **7.3** FTP update flow writing through to the profile
- [x] **7.4** `WorkoutSyncWorker` with a network constraint, retry ceiling, unique work, and a result it actually reads
- [x] **7.5** `ClassTemplateSeeder` listing the assets directory rather than a hardcoded category list
- [x] **7.6** Class template JSON in `assets/classes/`
- [x] **7.7** Seeding moved to application scope (a `LaunchedEffect` was cancelled by navigation mid-seed)

---

## Phase 8: Polish, Testing & Edge Cases

- [x] **8.1** Serial disconnection handled with a single backoff policy
- [x] **8.2** BLE disconnection handled without self-triggered reconnect loops
- [x] **8.3** Crash recovery via `is_complete`, surfaced through `WorkoutService.recoverableWorkout`
- [ ] **8.3a** **Show the recovery prompt in the UI** — the service exposes it, nothing renders it yet
- [ ] **8.4** Guest post-ride: save to a new profile, an existing profile, or discard (currently keep-or-discard only)
- [x] **8.5** Haptic feedback for zone alerts (`ZoneAlertManager`)
- [x] **8.6** TTS audio cues
- [ ] **8.6a** Wire `ZoneAlertManager` into the ride — it exists but nothing calls it
- [x] **8.7** Unit tests: `PowerZone`, `PostWorkoutAnalyzer`, `WorkoutMetricsCalculator`, `RideIntent`, `SerialProtocolParser`, `CadenceTracker`, `PowerModel`, BLE parsing, `IntervalParser` — **83 tests**
- [x] **8.8** Instrumented tests for Room DAOs (foreign key ordering, `is_complete` filtering, cascade delete)
- [ ] **8.8a** Instrumented test for `WorkoutService` lifecycle
- [ ] **8.9** Manual testing on Gen 1/Gen 2 Peloton hardware — *blocked*
- [x] **8.12** Verified end-to-end on an emulator: profile creation → class library → intervals → simulated ride → post-ride summary → persisted metrics

### 8.11 Material Expressive design

- [x] **8.11.0** Inter variable font (SIL OFL)
- [x] **8.11.1–8.11.3** Colour tokens, light/dark schemes, fitness metric palette
- [x] **8.11.4–8.11.6** Elevation, shape and motion tokens — **deduplicated**; there were two conflicting elevation scales and a shape scale that shadowed itself with literal-named tokens
- [x] **8.11.7–8.11.11** Theme wired to `MaterialTheme.shapes` so stock components use it
- [x] **8.11.11a** Dynamic colour made opt-in — it previously overrode the entire palette on API 31+, making the brand theme dead code on any modern device
- [x] **8.11.13** Fade-through screen transitions
- [x] **8.11.17** Dashboard redesign
- [x] **8.11.27–8.11.29** Class library with filter chips and duration badges
- [x] **8.11.32/34** Class detail with zone-coloured interval cards
- [x] **8.11.37–8.11.38** Intent prompt with descriptions
- [x] **8.11.48/50** Post-ride summary cards and RPE selector (now a `FlowRow` — ten 48dp buttons in a `Row` overflowed every phone screen, making the higher ratings untappable)
- [x] **8.11.52** FTP breakthrough dialog
- [x] **8.11.65–8.11.67** Content descriptions, 48dp touch targets, semantic headings
- [ ] **8.11.12** Shared element transitions between profile selector and dashboard
- [ ] **8.11.14** Container transform for library → detail
- [ ] **8.11.15** Predictive back for Android 14+
- [ ] **8.11.16** Navigation rail or bottom bar
- [ ] **8.11.18** Large expressive FAB for Just Ride
- [ ] **8.11.21** Dashboard skeleton loading states
- [ ] **8.11.30–8.11.31** Class search bar, empty-state illustrations
- [ ] **8.11.33/35/36** Sticky class header, start-button loading state, difficulty indicator
- [ ] **8.11.39–8.11.41** Preparation checklist, sensor status, countdown
- [ ] **8.11.42–8.11.47** HUD redesign: progress arcs, blur pause overlay, expressive alerts
- [ ] **8.11.49/51** Achievement badges, share button
- [ ] **8.11.53–8.11.57** Charts: power with zone overlay, heart rate, cadence distribution, PB comparison
- [ ] **8.11.58–8.11.64** Extract the remaining shared components (`ZoneBadge`, `ProgressArc`, `SkeletonLoader`)
- [ ] **8.11.68–8.11.69** High contrast mode, font scaling
- [ ] **8.11.70–8.11.80** Micro-interactions, shimmer, pull-to-refresh, scroll edge effects

> Items 8.11.53+ are cosmetic. Phase 9 is worth more than all of them: the app cannot yet run a class.

---

## Phase 9: Ride Integration — the current priority

**Goal:** Make a class actually run. Today a ride records telemetry and totals, but the class's own intervals do nothing and the floating HUD never appears.

### 9.1 Service lifecycle ✅
- [x] **9.1.1** Ride start launches `WorkoutService` as a foreground service with user, class, intent and FTP
- [x] **9.1.2** `RideViewModel` binds to the service and observes `workoutState` and `currentSession`
- [x] **9.1.3** End Ride stops the service and passes the real workout id to the summary

### 9.2 HUD overlay activation
- [ ] **9.2.1** Call `HudOverlayManager.show()` when a ride starts and `hide()` when it ends
- [ ] **9.2.2** Feed the service's elapsed-time and sensor flows into the overlay
- [ ] **9.2.3** Wire the overlay's pause/resume/stop to the service controls
- [ ] **9.2.4** Prompt for overlay permission at ride start when it is missing, rather than silently not appearing

### 9.3 Class interval engine
- [ ] **9.3.1** `ClassIntervalEngine` driving a timer over `List<Interval>` (parsing now works, so this is unblocked)
- [ ] **9.3.2** Emit `StateFlow<IntervalState>`: current interval, targets, elapsed and remaining time
- [ ] **9.3.3** Drive the HUD's target zone indicators from it
- [ ] **9.3.4** Auto-complete the workout when the class timer ends

### 9.3a Interval preview & countdown
- [ ] **9.3a.1** `nextInterval` in `IntervalState` for an upcoming-effort preview
- [ ] **9.3a.2** Prominent countdown during recovery intervals
- [ ] **9.3a.3** Preview card showing the next interval's zone colour and targets
- [ ] **9.3a.4** Five-second warning: flash plus haptic before an interval change
- [ ] **9.3a.5** "Give it everything" on the last *hard* interval, not merely the last one. If the final interval is recovery (Z1–Z2), show it on the penultimate one and "Cool down — ride easy" on the last. If the final interval is itself Z4+, show it directly. Never show a next-interval preview on the final interval.

### 9.4 Sensor data off-hardware ✅
- [x] **9.4.1** `SimulatedSensorProvider`
- [x] **9.4.2** Settings toggle between real and simulated input
- [x] **9.4.3** Graceful fallback when `/dev/ttyS2` is unavailable

### 9.5 Post-ride data flow ✅
- [x] **9.5.1** Final session collected from the service
- [x] **9.5.2** Real duration, average power, output and distance shown in the summary
- [x] **9.5.3** `PostWorkoutAnalyzer` run for FTP breakthrough detection
- [ ] **9.5.4** Enqueue `WorkoutSyncWorker` after a ride is saved — the worker is correct but nothing calls `enqueue()`

---

## Phase 10: Hardware Validation — blocked

Everything here needs a jailbroken Gen 1/Gen 2 bike.

- [ ] **10.1** Confirm the sensor board's device path and that it is readable
- [ ] **10.2** Confirm the byte protocol matches `SerialProtocolParser` (`C` ticks, `R`+value)
- [ ] **10.3** Calibrate `PowerModel` against a known-good power source — see 2.2.4
- [ ] **10.4** Verify the HUD renders over the Peloton video app
- [ ] **10.5** Verify a BLE strap connects and streams
- [ ] **10.6** Full-length ride: battery, thermals, memory, no dropped samples

---

## Quick Reference: Coggan 7-Zone Power Model

Bounds are **contiguous and half-open** (`lower ≤ pct < upper`). The published table quotes whole percentages, which leaves unassigned gaps between zones; modelling those literally means a rider at 55.5% of FTP matches no zone at all.

| Zone | Name | % of FTP | Training purpose |
|------|------|----------|------------------|
| Z1 | Active Recovery | < 56% | Warmup, cooldown |
| Z2 | Endurance | 56–76% | Aerobic base |
| Z3 | Tempo | 76–91% | Aerobic efficiency |
| Z4 | Lactate Threshold | 91–106% | Sustainable hard effort |
| Z5 | VO2 Max | 106–121% | Max oxygen uptake |
| Z6 | Anaerobic Capacity | 121–151% | Short power bursts |
| Z7 | Neuromuscular Power | ≥ 151% | Explosive sprints |

## Quick Reference: Ride Intent

`P_target = FTP × zone% × k`

| Intent | `k` | Effect |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Reach New Milestones | 1.05 | Targets 5% higher |
| Just Stay Fit | 0.95 | Targets 5% lower |
