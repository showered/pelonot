## Phase 20: Who's riding — the profile selector and avatars

The first screen anyone sees, and the one that has had the least thought. It is
also the screen that makes the shared-household story work: a bike in a living
room has three or four riders and picking the right one has to take one glance
and one tap, from two metres away, by someone who has already got their shoes
on.

The obvious reference is a TV streaming app's profile picker, and it is the
right one — same device shape, same distance, same job.

### 20.1 The profile selector

- [x] **20.1.1** **Centre the profiles and make them big.** Today they are
      small cards in a grid pinned to the top-left of a 1920×1080 screen, with
      the rest of it empty. Confirmed by screenshot on the tablet emulator, 31
      July 2026. *Rebuilt as a TV-picker: one centred row of square tiles with
      the heading above it, observed at 1920×1080/240 dpi*
- [x] **20.1.2** Landscape-first, centred both ways, sized off the screen rather
      than a fixed dp — this app runs on a tablet bolted to a bike, not a phone.
      *Tile size is derived from the available width and the number of tiles,
      bounded at both ends: a floor so a household of six stays tappable with
      sweaty hands, and a ceiling so one lone rider does not get a comic 500 dp
      square. The avatar and its initial scale with the tile — a fixed type
      style left a small letter marooned in a large circle*
- [x] **20.1.3** Guest keeps its distinct treatment (6.1) but stops competing
      with the real riders for the eye. It is the exception, not a peer.
      *A peer in layout, deliberately not in weight: riders are filled cards,
      Guest and New rider are outlined, so the eye lands on a real rider
      without having to read anything*
- [x] **20.1.4** "Create a new profile" belongs alongside the riders as one more
      tile, not as a full-width bar at the bottom of an otherwise empty screen
- [x] **20.1.5** Edit and delete a profile from here. Deleting one has to say
      what happens to their rides — `workouts.user_id` is `ON DELETE SET NULL`,
      so the rides survive as unattributed rather than being destroyed, and the
      dialog should say so rather than letting the rider guess. *Press and hold
      a rider. Rename is here because it is the one field Settings cannot
      change; FTP and weight stay there and the dialog says so. Removal reads
      "Their rides are kept — they stop being filed against anyone and stay in
      the history as unattributed."* Deleting the selected profile also clears
      `lastProfileId`, or the dashboard would go on greeting a rider who has
      been removed.
      **One trap worth carrying forward:** `Card(onClick = …)` has no
      long-press, and the first version put `onLongClick` in `semantics` only.
      That is an accessibility action, not a gesture — a real press-and-hold
      fell straight through to the click and opened the dashboard. It needs
      `Modifier.combinedClickable`

### 20.2 Avatars

- [ ] **20.2.1** A checked-in set of avatars to choose from. Licence first:
      whatever is used has to be genuinely open (SIL OFL, CC0 or MIT), credited
      in the repo, and vendored rather than fetched at runtime — the app starts
      a ride with no network and that is not negotiable (19.4). Generated
      identicon-style avatars derived from the profile name are the other
      candidate and have no licence question at all
- [ ] **20.2.2** `profiles.avatar` in Room, behind a real migration (12.5).
      Store a **reference** — a pack id or a relative file path — never image
      bytes in the row: a database that carries photos is a database that
      cannot be exported, synced or backed up cheaply
- [ ] **20.2.3** Pick from the built-in set at profile creation, with a sensible
      default so nobody is forced through a choice to start riding
- [ ] **20.2.4** **Set an avatar from the camera or the gallery on Android.**
      `PhotoPicker` on API 33+ and `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT` below it, so the
      common path needs no storage permission at all. Downscale and re-encode
      on import — a 12 MP phone photo has no business being loaded to draw a
      64dp circle — and write it into app-private storage
- [ ] **20.2.5** Strip EXIF on import, and honour the orientation tag before
      discarding it. A gallery photo carries GPS coordinates, and this one will
      end up synced (15) and possibly visible to friends (17.5)
- [ ] **20.2.6** Avatars appear wherever a rider is named: the selector, the
      dashboard greeting, history, and any leaderboard. Not on the HUD (18.6)
- [ ] **20.2.7** Avatar changes sync with the profile, once 14 and 15 work. A
      custom image is a blob and needs Supabase Storage rather than a column;
      decide deliberately whether it goes up at all before building it
- [ ] **20.2.8** Change your avatar from the companion web app — **much later**,
      and strictly after 17 exists. Listed here so it is not re-invented as a
      separate feature when it is the same field
